       "{'text': \" At home on every rural road, Hyundai Country Calendar. Fijohas, their exotic taste and goodness have made them a big Kiwi favourite. A bit of pineapple, a bit of strawberry, beautiful. New Zealand was the start of a new life for this family, and they now sell our Fijoas to the world. Mmm, but we're still making sure the locals are getting plenty. It's a perfect autumn day at the Southern Bell Orchard on the outskirts of Matamata and the whijoa harvest is underway. The pickers must harvest each individual fruit when it's in its prime. And no one knows more about achieving perfection than orchardist Franz de Jong. Touch picking is what we do here. So we just basically, the fruit when it feels a bit soft, you know, the wrinkles are gone and it has a slight give, you know, you're ready and then you can pull it and then it clicks off the tree. If you have to tear it off, like a little piece of paper on an A4, you know it's actually wrong, and then you have to cut it. So if you cut it in half, we can see if it's indeed ready as a local market or export fruit. See, we've got a nice little bit of gelliness in it, so you can get four weeks of shelf life out of it And this is what we want if fruit is on the ground it will only have a week And that's the whole difference. That's why we touch back here when they fall on the ground. It is easy That's what you can do with your home garden because you're gonna make an apple crumble feed your apple crumble the same day or the Next day that's all right, but for us. We really need to have two weeks of shelf life because from here grading that's all right. But for us, we really need to have two weeks of shelf life because from here grading, transporting it, going to a distribution center, from there going into a supermarket, you really need to have at least 10 days out of a feed yard before you can say it's actually where on the consumer's fruit bowl. And that's the difference. Frans and Tineke de Jong are speaking Frisian, the language of their native Friesland in the northwest corner of the Netherlands. Back home, Frans ran his own agriculture testing laboratory, and Tineke was a florist. But they were looking for new challenges. 13 years ago that we first set foot in this place. I'm just flying. They wanted a fresh start and New Zealand's rural lifestyle appealed. We said basically we wanted to do something with farming and coming here and do dairy farming would have been an option but we saw I was 45 and we thought to start getting into milking again early in the morning maybe we should look at something else they found there's something else just outside Matamata five hectares of greenhouses and a huge variety of fruit trees one block was blueberries and other block was persimmons and nashies, and there were two blocks of feijoas. We thought, oh, well, you're going to have blueberries and then you're going to have nashies, feijoas and then persimmons. But, of course, all these things intertwine and it became really hard in the packhouse to keep it all apart and then the capsicums on top of that. It was just too much. So we basically said, well, we'll just gradually remove first the persimmons and the nashes and then the blueberries and, yeah, and focus on the feature. I was outside and it's been a good move. You know, when you start something new, you just have to go for it. It's not a job from eight till five or something. You just have to work a lot of hours. And I was OK. I didn't mind at all. Yeah, really enjoyed it. Still enjoy it. The orchard gets busy in late spring when the delicate feijoa flowers need to be pollinated. That job is done by the birds. They're unwelcome at most orchards and vineyards, but at the De Jongs they get the red carpet treatment. We really love the birds here because we need them of course in that period of four or five weeks that all these flowers come out in November and December and we put about 100 birdhouses up in the whole orchard. So this flower is particularly designed to be pollinated by birds. They will come in and grab the petal. The petal is really, really sweet. You can just eat it like that. It's beautiful. The pollen is here, the stamen is there. So they will touch the pollen while they eat the petals and they go to the next flower and they cross pollinate the varieties. Franz and Tineke's son, Talbert, has joined the family business. I mainly do all the technical side of things on the orchard, but it's just a huge variety of work from tractor work to office work to doing some plumbing and irrigation lines to microelectronics in the greenhouse. Today, Talbot's helping with the compost run. It's a special mix designed to give the trees a boost during pollination. Good compost should smell like forest soil, and it is, and it is good, and we have heaps of worms in there, which is good well because we breed them in the compost heap so they will be spread out in the orchard and of course worms are doing a terrific good job in the soil as well the De Jong's have won a number of environmental awards for their biological approach to improving their soil Franz's former life as a scientist has come in handy. The compost will help to get the biology going and the roots will eventually take it up. It might take one or two years and the production will increase. We already see it happening. We've been using this method for four years now and the production we had last year was actually 20% higher than we expected. The same principles are used in the greenhouses where the De Jongs grow spray-free capsicums. Teneke De Jong is taking a break from the Whi Joa packhouse to help with today's pick. It's really peaceful. The green around you gives you a really earthy feeling as well. Time in the glasshouse for me is really my time, me time, time for myself. So, yeah, I can think about things that I want to do for the whole week, the planning for the whole week, what needs to be done, and do some time off time. Ha, ha, ha. and there's some time off time. Every care is taken to produce these capsicums. They're some of the most sought after in the Waikato and provide the family with some early income at the start of spring. These chilli-like sweet point capsicums are a favourite with the foodies. It's a really sweet capsicum are a favourite with the foodies. It's a really sweet capsicum, really sweet. So it's sweet without any heat. And it's really nice to grill them, put them in the oven and stuff them with little tomatoes, feta cheese, basil, garlic, couscous, they're beautiful. And people are flocking to buy their spray-free produce at local markets. See you later. Delicious Fijoa goodies. Enter to win at hyundaicountry.co.nz. That's incredible. It's breathtaking here.

The wind gets that strong around here in Mangarapa, it can blow a dog off the chain. Farm Insurance and the Rural Weather Outlook are brought to you by FMG. Hi everyone. Winter is flexing its muscles with the low pressure system lying over the upper north today, directing a bitterly cold southeast flow over the lower two thirds of the country. There's a brief break in the weather as that system moves away to the east. So, fun fact, onions are New Zealand's largest fresh vegetable export. Onion planting season for 2016 is nearly over. And next week, you can expect showers to continue from that next system set to push on tomorrow. Moves up the country and lingers over the upper north island through to wednesday while a ridge clears skies over the south the calving season is in full swing and with the price of calves quite high this year there's been reports of an increase of theft on farms farmers are encouraged to remain vigilant and contact police of any suspicious behavior fm, we're here for the good of the country. It's 8 o'clock on a Saturday morning and the Tauranga Farmers Market is officially open for business. In fact, at this farmers market, the locals break into a trot to get to their favourite suppliers before the queues. Today it's the last of the fresh blueberries. And there's always an early rush on the free-range eggs. Good morning. Things are more sedate for orchardist Talbot de Jong and his partner, Emily Meese. Mum and Dad are having a sleep-in, and we take turns every other weekend so that we can have a weekend on and a weekend off. Sure, just $4. Thank you. Would you like a carry bag at all? $6 change. We really enjoy going to the market. It's really good just talking directly to your customers and just getting the direct feedback about what they want and what they like. Thank you very much, like. Thank you. Back in Matamata, work at the Whijoa Orchard never stops. Every afternoon after picking, Talbot goes through the orchard collecting the day's harvest. We had quite warm weather in the previous month, so the fruit's sized up really nicely and it's ripened a lot quicker than normal, which is really good because we get the higher prices early in the season. It's just looking like it's going to be a crack of Fiji year for us. Talbot and his father Franz have worked hard to achieve a biological balance in the orchard. They haven't had to spray so far this year and already volumes are up. We were counting on about 35 tonnes and today we did the maths on what we've picked so far which is only two and a half weeks up into the season we already have 22 tons and so we're probably going to be way over 40 so we're way up from what we thought once the Fijas have been collected they're prepared for the pack house we're dipping the fruit in a mix of mainly water and alcohol and natural pyrethrum it's just to help kill any bugs that are on the fruit that are going to be a problem for us for export, mainly after killing the mealy bugs and scale insects. There's a few mites, but it also helps clean the fruit and the alcohol seems to help with the shelf life of the fruit a bit as well. During the harvest in April and May, the pace in the packhouse never lets up. We pick five days a week, Monday to Friday, and then we grade them on the Saturday as well. Sometimes it's quite overwhelming because you think like, oh my God, how are we getting this one done. That the fruit quality looks really beautiful and that we know that it's really healthy so the customers will be really happy with it. Tineke heads the pack house operation and working alongside her is Emily, her future daughter-in-law. It's a really intense concentration. Probably about a hundred decisions all at once, every fruit that you pick up. So any kind of marks, any skin damage that will affect the shelf life, anything that looks ugly in an export box, even though I might think it looks delicious to eat. It's really important that we get top quality into the export. Emily and Tineke are in the packhouse dawn to dusk, seven days a week. The work is repetitive, but there's also a bit of art involved. You have to have the right shapes in the right size boxes, with the water involved. to make a collar pattern sometimes. The smaller sizes are going to America at the moment and the big sizes are going to Australia. So yeah, in Australia they really know really well the big fruit so they want to have big sizes. While Tineke has the packhouse under control during harvest, Fran spends his days choreographing export orders. At this point of the year somebody needs to arrange that all. A lot of it has to do with filling the export orders in time if you can. Sometimes you can't because the fruit simply doesn't come off. It's a big juggling act because you need to arrange crates in time, you need to have export trays enough. You constantly anticipate what you need for the next week. The truckies have to arrive in time. You can't even write it down because you have to just work from your head. Not all the fruit goes to export or to the farmers market. Hey Harland, how's it going? Harland Sinclair and his Swedish wife Emma run Waikato's dinner delivery company, Emma's Foodbag. Here we are. Alright, let's have a look. This is the brainchild of my wife Emma. She saw the concept in Sweden and loved it. Emma, she saw the concept in Sweden and loved it. I'll bring this out. Part of my job is running around the Waikato and picking up all the freshest produce I can find. Nice one, look at this. Huge. And getting in the boxes and out to the customers. Harlan's picking up feijoa for Emma, who's in her test kitchen trialling new recipes for her customers. We're deep in feijawa season at the moment, so we've decided to do a healthy spin on a Fijawa crumble with some lovely nuts and seeds in it. And obviously we have to taste it and test it before we can send it out. Next on Emma's test menu, a Fijawa salsa. So we've got this lovely adventurous salsa. We've got the Fijoa's in there, they're nice and chopped up. We're just going to mash them through a little bit but still maintain a little bit of texture in there. The whole food bag concept and the dinner delivery system is just really in its infancy here in New Zealand and it can only grow and grow. Yeah, they're all looking really good actually. Emma and Harlan started their business three years ago. Their client list is constantly growing and their weekends are full on. Sunday morning is definitely the busiest time of the week for us. We're getting ready to send out the deliveries to the wider Waikato so it's a real buzz coming in here on a Sunday. This sort of product just ticks a lot of boxes for people, for busy families and working professionals that value healthy eating and delicious dinners. It's especially rewarding for us when we get to work closely with the growers so we can talk to them, we can make sure that the menus are done seasonally and timely, that the product that we get is specific to the recipe that we're sending to our customers. So it just really kind of links that whole story from when the fruit's grown to when the customer's enjoying their dinners. So much work and care and effort goes into that. And there we go, a lovely free-range chicken breast with a Fijoa and chilli salsa. As a nation, we can't get enough of Fijoas. Be in quick for a chance to land yourself a Fijoa feast with this week's prize hamper filled with delicious Fijoa goodies. Enter to win at hyundaicountry.co.nz Hello, London Palladium!

Next, a bit of Go West, a bit of Meghan Trainor, a bit of something for everyone tonight at the London Palladium. Then discover the hidden treasures of Sicily and Alex Polizzi's secret Italy. And later, have they taken their secret too far? Sophie's not impressed in Coro. A perfect autumn morning, and the harvest at the Southern Bell Orchard in Matamata is already underway. The De Jong family ensure nothing goes to waste. They embrace recycling. The unwanted material from the orchard and glasshouse all goes straight into the compost bin. For owner Franz de Jong, it's a perfect fuel for the next crop. All these leaves contain all the nutrients that have been put into the glasshouse over the whole season and it would be a waste to just chuck them out and put them in a waste bin and send them off. The bins are then emptied into a huge compost pile at the back of the orchard. It's sustainability in motion. The compost itself, the whole process as we do it, takes about two years, so it's a slow composting system. We use the nutrients that we already have in this beautiful organic matter, and then we add on in fertiliser what we to to use to get it up to the optimum level so it's a really good way of getting organic nutrients which have been sitting in this beautiful organic matter being available to the plants when they want it it doesn't leach out because it's it's it's humus so it sits in there and that and that's really the big benefit of it. Plus the fact that we haven't been wasting nutrients, we just use them. We didn't pay any extra money for extra fertiliser. We actually got that here, and it's beautiful stuff. Farming, it has its ups and downs, but when you have it right and you know it's going to be there for times to come, that's really good. For Franz, the message is simple. It's about getting back to basics. Look after the soil and the plants will learn to look after themselves. We call ourselves biological sustainable. For me, it's more like the sustainability that drives us than organic and try to create an ecosystem that will work for the plants that you grow. The greenhouses are run by sophisticated computers keeping the plants in perfect balance. The electronic watering system adds extra nutrients and processes data from the vines telling it how much water is required. In the summer you can evaporate in this greenhouse as much as 7,000 litres a day. That's seven spa pools full of water. At the moment, probably two to three. And in the winter, just before we stop, it might only be one spa pool full of water. Computers may be in control in the greenhouse, but if Fran sees a pest, he'll take action. If I have to spray, I will spray, yes. Franz's son, Talbot, and partner, Emily, are equally committed to the orchard. They moved here from Auckland three years ago and plan to stay. He's nearly finished though. A few more picks. Emily suffers from arthritis, but being active around the orchard helps keep the pain under control and they like the commute. Yeah, we're pretty lucky with our commute. It's a nice and short, brisk walk through the orchard in the morning and no traffic jams on the way, so it's very good. Last year, Franz and Tineke built Talbot and Emily a house in the orchard. Well, it was all part of the succession plan to help them. I mean, for them to rent a place in Metameta and not be on the job would be obviously harder on us as well because we would do the night chores. I still can't believe how fortunate we are to have a brand new house and we're so young and I know most people have to work their whole lives to achieve a beautiful new house and it's really amazing it's like getting the reward up front for another 30 or 40 years of hard work or longer maybe. Sometimes I have to pinch myself when I look out at our view. When we go over there, we knock on the doors and we first wait till they say, yeah, you can come in. And that's the other way around as well. We don't want to have them, well, they can come in our house all the time, but they do exactly the same. They respect our space as well. We don't want to have them, well, they can come in our house all the time, but they do exactly the same. They respect our space as well. Because you're already 24 hours almost with each other at the moment, so yeah, it's good to have some time off as well. Being close to family can be hard, but it's also got its advantages. And if we run out of wine, then just pop next door and grab one of theirs. We did actually do that last week. With a lot of hard work behind them, the de Jong's determination to create a future for their family is now a reality. It's a perfect Kiwi dream, full of family and Fijoas. The Fijoas is what we believe in, and I think in the far future, probably that Fijaua will be as big as the Kiwi industry. That is my big dream. We make three steps forward and two back, and in the end, there's always still one step forward, so we will get there. I think it's just going to be a great future together as a family. It already feels like a lovely family lifestyle, I think it's just going to be a great future together as a family. It already feels like a lovely family lifestyle and I think eventually we'll have children and they can run around and eat lots of fija and just a lovely life together. We have plenty of young trees here and we'll be around here until they grow old. Like to know more about this story? Go to our website or find us on Facebook. Country Calendar is brought to you by Hyundai New Zealand. Next time... We put a lot of emphasis on real farming, Because when you do it next time, try to slow down a bit, OK? We basically view our farms as classrooms. A husband and wife team managing a sheep station and training tomorrow's farmers. Out here, we're so isolated. We like to make them feel welcome and make sure they're enjoying it as well as doing their work. That's next time on Hyundai Country Calendar. Captions by Red Bee Media\",\n",
